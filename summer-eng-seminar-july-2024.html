                        <p>about 2 weeks ago, i attended the summer engineering seminar at santa clara university and,
                            to say the least, it was life-changing. </p>
                        <h3>day 1:</h3>
                        <p>i arrived at the university pretty tired after a long trip from reno (i took the train).
                            after some rest, we had dinner and met our teammates. i was in the aerospace engineering
                            group and got to know my new group over some pretty nice and filling teriyaki dinner. then,
                            we had our first activity, a photo scavenger hunt, which was so much fun. afterwards, we hit
                            up the local 7-eleven for snacks for the week and then went back to the dorms. the dorms
                            were single-person with a shared bathroom for two rooms, but the person i was supposed to
                            share with couldn't make it.</p>

                        <h3>day 2:</h3>
                        <p>we started the day at 7am and went straight to breakfast at 8am. our first
                            session was an intro to engineering by dr. kyrarini. it was super interesting getting
                            introduced to our final project. then, we had a session on mechanical engineering which was
                            really fun and hands-on. my team built a boat powered by the marangoni effect that moved
                            pretty far! after lunch, we had a bioengineering session. as someone who's never taken a
                            biology class in my life, this was actually such a cool session. we learned about a wearable
                            sensor some grad students and seniors were working on to help determine hand
                            movements/exercises. each day we did about three workshops, then had recreation, dinner, and
                            group time.</p>

                        <h3>day 3:</h3>
                        <p>we started the workshops at the sobrato building with a computer science and engineering
                            workshop. it was pretty interesting and we discussed how easy it is for someone to stalk you
                            with publicly available information. we leave so much info online that we don't realize how
                            easy it is for someone to make a profile of us. next was a civil engineering workshop. it
                            wasn't my favorite, but it was still interesting. we got to build a bridge and test its
                            strength. my fave session of the entire seminar was the electrical engineering workshop
                            where we worked with an stm disco board (a faster version of an arduino) to code some led
                            lights and add patterns to them. we then had rec time, but dinner had a twist. i went at
                            6:30pm, only to find that there was no more food and the chef had gone home. so, i dashed to
                            7-eleven for a fruit salad before the meetup at 6:55pm. i made it on time! we had a really
                            fun activity before group time, trying to cushion an egg to survive a drop. our team almost
                            made it past all stages, but it cracked on the last level.</p>
