                        <p>so i built a bed for my first woodwork project. it was a lot of work but i'm super proud of
                            it,
                            tbh, and i really like how it turned out.</p>

                        <h3>how did i get here</h3>
                        <p>for about 3 years now, i've had a very cozy bed on some wooden pallets i found. for those who
                            know me i'm super into thrifting and reusing stuff so the wooden pallets was a win for me. i
                            loved it but i kinda got bored of it and wanted to spice things up a bit. that's when the
                            idea
                            to build a bed hit me.</p>

                        <h3>the process</h3>
                        <p>it took me about a week to build the bed and some two weeks for it to dry and i didn't even
                            get
                            to sleep until a month later. first, we had to measure the pallets and cut them to size so
                            the
                            mattress fit, sand the wood pieces down, and then varnish them. tbh, i wasn't a huge fan of
                            the
                            varnish color but aye, you gotta work with what you have. we also had to buy some wood for
                            the
                            sides, plus nails to hold everything together. the biggest challenge? using the electric
                            saw. IT
                            WAS SCARY OMG, i'd never used one before. the wood was also pretty weak, which is expected
                            because pallets are made from the lowest quality wood since they're meant for single use.
                        </p>

                        <h3>what i've learnt</h3>
                        <p>one thing i've learned is that ear and eye protection is a must. when we were using the saw,
                            there were wood chips flying everywhere and those could definitely hurt someone real bad. my
                            bose headphones did a really great job at cancelling most of the noise but the saw was still
                            pretty loud even with the headphones on. another rlly important thing is that stuff will
                            take
                            time, especially the stuff you least expect. we had to wait about 2 weeks for the varnish
                            smell
                            to disappear even tho the varnish was pretty much dry a few hours after we painted it on.
                            luckily, i was halfway across the world during that time, so i didn't feel the long wait.
                            also,
                            this one's kinda weird, but i've learned that sparks often don't hurt??? if i had to make a
                            tier
                            list of things i thought would be painful, i'd 100% have sparks at the top.</p>
