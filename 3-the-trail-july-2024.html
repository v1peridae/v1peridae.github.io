                        <h3>day 6:</h3>
                        <p>this was our last day of actual backpacking. we walked about 8 km to the trailhead we started
                            at
                            and got to chill there for a while, then looked for a campsite. i yet again had another
                            moment
                            of aura loss when i fell and tore my leggings, which i didn't know about until i was in my
                            tent.
                            i genuinely wanted to cry for a while. i was pretty glad but sad to be officially done with
                            all
                            the hard hiking. i kind of missed the weird happiness i got when i made it to each campsite
                            and
                            realized that after we made it to the trailhead, i wouldn't feel that way again. we also saw
                            a
                            bear in the woods from the restpoint which was pretty sick since i've only ever seen bears
                            in
                            movies lol.</p>

                        <h3>day 7:</h3>
                        <p>we spent lots of time chilling at the campsite until someone checked the slack and saw
                            someone
                            from a different team eating a burger. we were a bit confused, then we realized the other
                            teams
                            made it to the other side and they had lunch. so we quickly packed our stuff and got
                            transport
                            to reno where we got some food. i was kind of sad to be back to reno because i liked
                            connecting
                            with nature (i indeed enjoy touching grass). when we got back, we stayed at a motel
                            6 until the 20th (i had to stay there with some other folks until the 21st since my train to
                            san
                            jose was then). </p>

                        <h3>post-trail</h3>
                        <p>i spent most of the 20th with everyone else at the hotel, this was during the crowdstrike
                            outage
                            so lots of people left a lot later in the day. also the first time i got to try boba my
                            friend
                            and i walked about 1hr to a boba shop near the university of nevada. reno had tons of
                            casinos
                            and i couldn't imagine how many more there probably were in las vegas. </p><br>

                        <p>the trail was awesome (ignoring the fact i probably nearly died a couple of times), and i'm
                            super
                            grateful to the team that made it possible. i had lots of
                            fun learning about pcbs, seeing everyone's cool projects, and obviously hiking. thank you
