                        <h3>day 3:</h3>
                        <p>we walked 16 km on this day. most tiring day for sure. the weather was a bit more
                            considerate, so
                            i didn't have a terrible headache and most of our walk was downhill. the view was so pretty
                            on
                            this day, and get this, there was still snow on some parts!!</p>
                        <p>we got to a small lakeside campsite, chilled there, and swam a bit in the lake. i was so
                            tired,
                            so right after swimming and i went to sleep. i noticed that during the hike i
                            wasn't feeling hungry much (WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE I MADE AND GO 2 DAYS
                            LIVING
                            OFF OF ELECTROLYTES AND HALF CLIF BARS).</p>

                        <h3>day 4:</h3>
                        <p>peak aura loss day -- i was sick. i slept in until 10am, and when i woke up, the whole world
                            was
                            spinning, and i had a fever. this was also the day people had the option to leave since it
                            was
                            the closest point we would be from a road until we finished the hike. lots of people left,
                            like
                            from my group alone about 3 people. it was VERY tempting to go back and get a hotel or
                            something, but i really wanted to keep on going. luckily, that day we stayed in since there
                            was
                            another thunderstorm warning (tbh, i found it SOOO weird how literally it could be 36Â°C and
                            then
                            BOOM thunderstorm warning). i spent most of that day resting and i got a new
                            tentmate from the thunderstorm, and she was so cool to be around.</p>
                        <p>ALSO, I'VE BEEN MEANING TO RANT ABOUT THIS, BUT SOMEONE FROM THE TAIL GROUP TOOK MY BEAR BAG
                            WITH
                            ALL MY FOOD :( but my teammates gave me some food, which i'm super grateful for :)</p>

                        <h3>day 5:</h3>
                        <p>we walked 16 km that day. our team decided to walk back since we were worried about having no
                            water supply for 10 miles. our water filter was also significantly slower since it was doing
                            its
                            job filtering water, so going 10 miles with not enough water wouldn't have been a good idea.
                            i
                            was feeling a lot better, and i was so happy to be back on the trail. we had a lot of uphill
                            that day, and i had to take a lot more breaks since i didn't want to push myself to the
                            point of
                            passing out. everyone was super understanding of how i was feeling, which i really
                            appreciate.
                            we got to the 2nd campsite we stopped at. we rested there, and it was so cold that night,
                            omg.
