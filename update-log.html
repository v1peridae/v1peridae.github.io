<h1>update log</h1>
<h4>the lack of css is intentional</h4>

<p>august 2024 - removed pictures, made blog, added update log page</p><br>

<p>june 2024 - renamed photography to pictures (mostly so i can share more and not be limited to only
    photography) and added pictures. also removed guestbook so i can make my own from scratch.</p> <br>

<p>february 2024 - revamped the entire website and this version is now currently online.</p>
