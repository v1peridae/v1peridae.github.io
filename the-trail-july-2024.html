                        <h3>pre-trail</h3>
                        <p>so after i built the bed (refer to the last post), i caught a flight to the other side of the
                            globe to do lots of stuff. but obviously, as you can tell by the title, i'm going to be
                            talking
                            about the trail, a hikeathon (hiking + hackathon). so, i landed in reno at 4pm and started
                            prepping for the hike the
                            next day: packing up freeze-dried food, and shopping for a few more things. a few weeks
                            before
                            that, we were working on the different stuff we'd submit to the hikeathon. my group
                            submitted an
                            nfc badge that would open a website with everyone's projects on it.</p>

                        <h3>day 1:</h3>
                        <p>started off with quite a bang since ups hadn't delivered our badges for the hike, so we left
                            a little late. but we made it to donner pass where the trail started. at around 4pm, we
                            kicked
                            it off and walked about 2 miles to our first campsite.</p>
                        <p>i forgot to mention that we were about 30-something people, and each group had 10-12 people.
                            the
                            groups were split into head (fastest), body (medium-paced - i was here), and tail
                            (slower-paced). we got to the campsite, had dinner, and the first thing i did was sleep and
                            sleep and sleep (i was still pretty jetlagged).</p>

                        <h3>day 2:</h3>
                        <p>we woke up at 8am, had breakfast, and started walking at 9am. we walked about 4 kilometers
                            (sorry
                            americans) that day. we did stop for lunch, but after that, we got a thunderstorm warning,
                            so we
                            set up camp there.</p>
                        <p>this was by far my worst day since i was jetlagged and overheating very fast. usually, even
                            in
                            like 40Â°C, i'd just get a headache, but i quite literally nearly passed out ON THE EDGE OF A
                            HILL. -900,000 aura moment fr (i lose aura on multiple occasions btw). the overheating was
                            because of some medication which makes you more likely to be dehydrated in the summer too. i
                            was
                            very much considering going off the meds for a while until the hike was over, but that
                            would've
                            probs had worse side effects.</p>
                        <p>anyways, there was in fact a thunderstorm, but we were all warm and cozy in our tents. i had
                            a
                            tent to myself for a while since i was the only girl in my group.</p>
