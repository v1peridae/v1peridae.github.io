                        <p>when i came back from the us, i brought back with me an arduino kit. i had some arduino
                            experience from a class i took but it was all on tinkercad and that was pretty much it. so i
                            started off with a goal and the plan is to build small stuff that build to that main goal.
                        </p>
                        <h3>so what's this main goal?</h3>
                        <p>it's simple really, i want to automate as many stuff as i can in my life, so i'm thinking
                            automating my garden, all the lights at home, the gate and probably feeding my cat. </p>

                        <h3>stage 1: lights</h3>
                        <p>so this post is going to be about stage 1, where i deal with my lights. so what i did was i
                            made an automatic light switch when i open my door (which just so happens to be an event
                            that takes place when im leaving or entering my room).</p>
                        <p>i wasn't sure what i wanted to use as a sensor but at the end i stuck to the ultrasonic
                            sensor since i felt like that was just gonna work better tho in the future i probably might
                            try out doing it with motion sensors placed around my room.</p>
                        <p>so i started off by connecting the ultrasonic sensor to the arduino and then connecting the
                            arduino to a servo motor which basically presses the light switch. later on i'm going to
                            make it in such a way that doesn't need like an external actuator and stuff, like everything
                            happens inside the light switch case and theres a relay that does all that instead. </p>
                        <p>so then i worked on the code which was lightwork and it wasn't anything too complex or
                            overwhelming :)</p>
                        <p>i havent recorded any samples of it working since its still in the works but i'm currently
                            working on casing it so it doesn't look so unappealling lol</p>
                        <p>i also want to build alexa support from scratch in the future when i get a hue bulb.</p>
